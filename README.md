## Installing

[Install instructions](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/installation/quick-start)

## Install Bee
The swarm thrives on decentralisation, and Bee is designed so that it works best when many individuals contribute to the health and distributed nature of the system by each running a Bee node.

It is easy to set up Bee on small and inexpensive computers, such as a Raspberry Pi 4, spare hardware you have lying around, or even a cheap cloud hosted VPS (we recommend small, independent providers and colocations).

-Installing Bee
Bee is packaged for MacOS and Ubuntu, Raspbian, Debian and CentOS based Linux distributions.

If your system is not supported, please see the manual installation section for information on how to install Bee.

-INFO
If you would like to run a hive of many Bees, checkout the node hive operators section for information on how to operate and monitor many Bees at once.

To install Bee you will need to go through the following process.

Set up the external signer for Bee, Bee Clef. (Recommended)
Install Bee and set it up to run as a service.
Configure Bee.
Fund your node with XDAI and BZZ
Wait for your chequebook transactions to complete and batch store to update.
Check Bee is working.
Install Bee Clef#
Bee makes use of Go Ethereum's external signer, Clef.

Because Bee must sign a lot of transactions automatically and quickly, a Bee specific version of Clef, bee-clef has been packaged which includes all the relevant configuration and implements the specific configuration needed to make Clef work with Bee.

-Ubuntu / Debian / Raspbian
-CentOS
-MacOS

## AMD64
-wget 'https://github.com/ethersphere/bee-clef/releases/download/v0.5.0/bee-clef_0.5.0_amd64.deb
-sudo-dpkg-i-bee-clef_0.5.0_amd64.deb`

## ARM (Raspberry Pi)

## ARMv7
-wget 'https://github.com/ethersphere/bee-clef/releases/download/v0.5.0/bee-clef_0.5.0_armv7.deb
-sudo-dpkg-i-bee-clef_0.5.0_armv7.deb`

## ARM64

-sudo-dpkg-i-bee-clef_0.5.0_arm64.deb`

Finally, let's check Bee Clef is running.

Linux
MacOS

## Welcome!
Hello and welcome to the swarm! We are very happy to have you here with us! üêù

As soon as your Bee client is up and running you will begin to connect with peers all over the world to become a part of Swarm, a global p2p network tasked with storing and distributing all of the world's data.

Swarm is a decentralised data storage and distribution technology, ready to power the next generation of censorship resistant, unstoppable serverless apps.

Swarm is economically self-sustaining due to a built-in incentive system enforced through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Swarm aspires to shape the future towards a self-sovereign global society and permissionless open markets. Applications can run autonomously yet securely in a planetary-scale deployment and execution environment.

## Bee
Installation#
Don't have Bee installed yet? It's easy! Head over to the installation section to get Bee up and running.

## Working With Bee
Once you have Bee installed, find out how to configure your software, interact with the API, monitor what Bee is up to, and make those all important backups in the working with Bee section.

## Access the Swarm
To learn more about how to get the most out of Bee, find out how to access the swarm section so you can share files with your friends, use Bee to host a website on a public Swarm Gateway, and much more!

## Incentives
Need even more incentive to get involved with the wonderful world of Swarm? Find out how you'll soon be earning BZZ tokens for storing and distributing your share of the world's data - sharing is caring!

## Find Out More
What happens with your Bee node when you start it up? Want to know more about the amazing Swarm technology behind Bee? Want to make your own client? Read The Book of Swarm, our 250 page epic guide to the future tech underpinning the Swarm network.

## Development
We'd love for you to join our efforts! Are you up to the challenge of helping us to create Bee and the other incredible technologies we're building on top of it? You are invited to contribute code to the Bee client or any of the other projects in Swarm's Ethersphere.

## Community
There is a vibrant and buzzing community behind Swarm - get involved in one of our group channels:

- Swarm
- Discord
- Twitter @ethswarm
- reddit channel
- Medium

## Reporting a bug
If your Bee isn't working, get in touch with the #bee-support channel on Discord or let us know on GitHub! üêù

Thanks for beeing here, we wish you Love and Bees from the Swarm Team x

## Quick Start
Bee is a versatile piece of software that caters for a diverse array of use cases.

- Access the Network
If you want to interact with the Bee ecosystem in a decentralised way, but not earn BZZ by storing or forwarding chunks, simply run a Bee light node in the background on your laptop or desktop computer. This will enable direct access to the swarm from your web browser and other applications.

-Install Bee

Support the Network and Earn BZZ by Running a Full Node#
Earn BZZ and help keep the swarm strong by running your own full node. It's easy to set up your own Bee on a Raspberry Pi, cloud host, or any home computer that's connected to the internet.

-Install Bee

## Run Your Own Hive of Nodes
Take it to the next level by keeping a whole hive of Bees! We provide tooling and monitoring to help you manage large deployments of multiple Bee nodes: Bee Hives.
