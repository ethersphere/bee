## DISCLAIMER
This software is provided to you "as is", use at your own risk and without warranties of any kind.
It is your responsibility to read and understand how Swarm works and the implications of running this software.
The usage of Bee involves various risks, including, but not limited to:
damage to hardware or loss of funds associated with the Ethereum account connected to your node.
No developers or entity involved will be liable for any claims and damages associated with your use,
inability to use, or your interaction with other nodes or the software.

## Versioning

There are two versioning schemes used in Bee that you should be aware of. The main Bee version does **NOT** follow
strict Semantic Versioning. Bee hosts different peer-to-peer wire protocol implementations and individual protocol breaking changes would necessitate a bump in the major part of the version. Breaking changes are expected with bumps of the minor version component. New (backward-compatible) features and bug fixes are expected with a bump of the patch component. Major version bumps are reserved for significant changes in Swarm's incentive structure.


The second set of versions that are important are the Bee's API versions (denoted in our [Bee](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee/blob/master/openapi/Swarm.yaml) and [Bee Debug](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee/blob/master/openapi/SwarmDebug.yaml) OpenAPI specifications). These versions **do follow**
Semantic Versioning and hence you should follow these for breaking changes.
