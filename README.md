# Ethereum Swarm Bee

This is a fork of [bee](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee) that uses [BadgerDB](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger) instead of [LevelDB](https://github.com/syndtr/goleveldb) to improve performance and reduce disk io requirements. 

This fork is only updated after an upstream release and as I have time to work on it.
