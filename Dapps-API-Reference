## Dapps#
Swarm is all about dapps. We strive to provide the most developer friendly environment

 on which to build your decentralised organisation. Built on the principles of functionality, flexibility and accessibility, 
 Bee provides high level constructs for file storage, feeds and key-value stores, while also providing the low level access with libraries

 that create Single Owner and Trojan chunks clientside, with total e2e privacy. Learn more about how to develop on Swarm.
