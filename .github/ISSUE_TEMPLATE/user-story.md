# User story
<!--  
This is the template to create a user story. A user story should be finished in one sprint and deliver added value to the source code (product increment). A (draft) PR always references the user-story.
-->
## Story

<!--  
Your user story should be in the form:  As a <user> I want <feature> such that <benefit of feature/product increment>`
A user can be anybody who interacts with the Swarm code (node operator/app developer/client developer).
-->

## Acceptance criteria

<!--  
Clear and verifiable criteria to verify that a user story is completed. Things such as tests and documentation don't need to be included here (but are assumed to be done)
-->

## Background

<!--  
Mention here the reason of the user story, any technical details, link to meeting notes, architecture diagrams, etc. 
-->

## Tasks

<!--  
Tasks are actionable items, which may contain technical details. A user story is usually broken down in multiple tasks and assigned to a person. If you have many tasks, please consider making this user story an epic
