# Epic
<!--  
This is the template to create an epic. An epic contains a user story as description and a background. Epics are broken down in user-stories (when possible or when there are some sub-tasks or when the implementation is not clear yet) or tasks (when there are no sub-tasks, and implementation is clear).
-->

## Story
<!--  
Your user story should be in the form:  As a <user> I want <feature> such that <benefit of feature/product increment>`
A user can be anybody who interacts with the Swarm code (node operator/app developer/client developer).
-->

## Background
<!--  
Mention here the reason of the user story, any technical details, link to meeting notes, architecture diagrams, etc. 
-->
